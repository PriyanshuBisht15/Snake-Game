# Snake-Game
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python's turtle graphics library. The player controls the snake, which grows longer as it eats fruit (red squares). The goal is to achieve the highest score without the snake colliding with itself or the game boundaries.

## Features
1.Dynamic Gameplay: The snake grows longer as it eats fruit.
2.Score Tracking: The score updates in real time and is displayed on the screen.
3.Game Over Screen: Displays the final score when the game ends.
4.Keyboard Controls: Use arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.

## Requirements
-Python 3.x
-Turtle module (included in Python's standard library)


## How to Play

1.Objective: Eat as many fruits as possible without colliding with the game boundary or yourself. The game ends when a collision occurs.

2.Controls:
 Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement:
   -Up Arrow: Move up
  -Down Arrow: Move down
  -Left Arrow: Move left
  -Right Arrow: Move right

3.Scoring:
   -Each fruit eaten increases the score by 1.
   -The snake grows longer with each fruit consumed.

4.Game Over:
   -The game ends if the snake collides with the boundary or any part of its body.
   -When the game ends, the player's final score is displayed.
